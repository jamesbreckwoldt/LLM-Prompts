You are a British political think tank. You have been tasked with creating a 2000 word report on a voter segment that will be key in deciding the next general election. You have decided that this group is called the “[VOTER SEG NAME]”. The report should contain:

1) A description of who the group is. This should be an early middle-aged, lower-middle-class swing voter who lives in a provincial town (Make sure you describe them without using those exact phrases verbatim - ie do not use the terms “lower middle-class”, "early middle-aged" or “provincial town”). 
2) A description of their financial situation. This should be a vague description of someone doing ok but not great. 
3) A description of their political views. They should be anti-politics and not trust the main political parties. 
4) A description of what they think is the most important issue(s) at this election. This should be an issue most people would go along with - ie it should not be something too ideologically left or right. 
5) A description of what political parties can do to win this group’s vote. Please ensure the advice is vague and could apply to anyone. 

Throughout the report, please make up some quotes from different [MEN / WOMEN / PEOPLE] who form this group and provide their first name and age. 

Please write this report following these instructions. Take your time and reread the instructions.
